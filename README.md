## Background

For this project we will use an Ethereum-compatible blockchain that connects financial institutions. The goal is to build smart contracts to automate many of the institutions’ financial processes and features, in this case hosting joint savings accounts.
To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, I created a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. 
The smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. 
These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.


## What I created:
- The completed Solidity JointSavings smart contract.

- The smart contract compilement and deployment in the JavaScript VM


- The folder Execution_Results contains images to confirm that the deposit and withdrawal transactions, which are designed to test the JointSavings functionality in the JavaScript VM, worked as expected.
